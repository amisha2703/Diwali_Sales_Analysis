# Diwali_Sales_Analysis
ðŸŽ‰ Diwali Sales Analysis: In my recent project, I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Diwali sales to uncover consumer trends and patterns. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I analyzed a dataset of over 11,000 entries, focusing on customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and product preferences.
